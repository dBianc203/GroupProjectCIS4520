HOW TO ACCESS OUR WEBPAGE/PROJECT (2 DIFFERENT WAYS) 


URL to webpage that isnt connected to database that holds usernames and passwords, so you can just hit login to proceed 
1) https://projectatm.000webhostapp.com/

2.) Use XAMPP
- download our project via github 
- You can download XAMPP at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
- after the program is installed, you need to locate the htdocs folder inside the xampp folder(where you installed it) 
- once you find the htdocs folder, place all of the html files in the html folder of our project, along with the PHP files of our project, into the htdocs folder. Along with the css folder (SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS)
